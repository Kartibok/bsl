British Sign Language

For years I wanted to learn British Sign Language, for numerous reasons, not least the fact that there are currently 151,000 users within the UK. I just never seemed to have the time.

I have been trying to learn online with a number of YouTube channels including Commanding Hands (https://www.youtube.com/@CommandingHands) and felt that I needed to speed up my actions against the words learned. I thought of using something like Anki to see if flash cards would work, but without a requirement to actually check it against a video or image, I really just wanted a number of things to happen:

* Once the program had started, a window to pop up and display a number of things:
  1. The Name of the program.
  2. The number of words in total, that I would be tested on as well as that counting down after each word.
* It should take the words from a text file, that contains the words I want to be tested on, and would be held in the same folder.
* I should be able to just look at the code and amend the delay in seconds easily.

I wanted to use python rather than bash as I thought others may want to use the code on Windows.

If anyone has any questions please just ask. When I have a moment I will look to make a Windows executable file.

Regards
